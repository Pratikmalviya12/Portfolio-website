   * Available background variants for the portfolio:
   * 
   * 1. 'neural' - Animated neural network with pulsing nodes and connections
   *    - Perfect for tech/AI portfolios
   *    - Subtle blue/indigo color scheme
   *    - Interactive node connections
   * 
   * 2. 'particles' - Connected particle system
   *    - Floating particles with dynamic connections
   *    - Clean, modern look
   *    - Responsive to screen size
   * 
   * 3. 'waves' - Flowing wave animation
   *    - Smooth, calming wave motion
   *    - Great for creative portfolios
   *    - Layered gradient effects
   * 
   * 4. 'geometric' - Rotating geometric shapes
   *    - Hexagonal patterns
   *    - Minimalist design
   *    - Perfect for design portfolios
   * 
   * 5. 'gradient' - Static gradient background
   *    - Performance-friendly option
   *    - Beautiful color combinations
   *    - Accessibility compliant
   * 
   * Usage in Layout component:
   * <Layout backgroundVariant="neural">
   *   {your content}
   * </Layout>
   * 
   * The backgrounds automatically respect user's motion preferences
   * and fall back to static gradients when reduced motion is preferred.
